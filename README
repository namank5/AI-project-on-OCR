Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, 
handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo 
(for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image 
(for example from a television broadcast).
